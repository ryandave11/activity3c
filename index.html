The daughter wondered what her mother was trying to do while she was complaining about her life. After some time the mother turned down the burner, fished the carrots and the eggs out and placed them in a bowl.  Then she ladled the coffee out into a cup.  Turning to her daughter, she asked, “Dear, Tell me what do you see?”. “A Carrot, egg and coffee.” she replied.

  <td align="justify" style="font-size:20px">All the three items, carrot, egg, and coffee went through the same situation , the boiling water . However, each reacted differently. The carrot was strong, hard, and unrelenting.  However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak.  The egg was fragile with the thin outer shell and its liquid interior.  But after being in the boiling water, it hardened its interior.  The ground coffee beans were unique, as it came to the boiling water, it changed the water and gave its incredible aroma.
